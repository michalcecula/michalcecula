## Hello there 👋 I'm Michał
Before I discovered the possibilities of Software Quality Engineering I gained experience in logistics and built my own business. Do you know how I came up with the idea of change?👇

I first heard about software testing when I was invited to participate as a "Beta Tester" for a blockchain-based project. This marked the beginning of my transition towards a career in testing. Since then, I have been constantly enhancing my qualifications and skills, dedicating a significant portion of my time to this project. The portfolio is the result of my regular activities in the "world of quality assurance". Enjoy reading :)
